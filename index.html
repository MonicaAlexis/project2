                <p class="ptext">Tests on Sunday morning, December 6, have shown that first-team player Ousmane Dembélé has a hamstring elongation.
                He will therefore not be considered for selection and the evolution of the injury will determine his availability.</p>

                <p class="ptext">Against Cádiz, the French winger, coming off the bench, participated in his 12th game of the year and had, to that point,
                scored four goals.</p>

                <h3>Recovery training</h3>
                <p class="ptext">This Sunday morning the available players of the first team worked out on pitch 2 of the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper. 
                For those that played at Cádiz, a recovery session was the order of the day.</p>

                <p class="ptext">Koeman's squad will train again on Monday, at 11.00am CET, as they continue to prepare for the Champions League match
                against Juventus at the Camp Nou. Thereafter, the Dutch coach and a Barça player will appear at a press conference, which
                can be followed live on Barça TV +.</p>
