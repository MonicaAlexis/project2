        <h2>THE KILLER’S BURIAL</h2>
        <img src="../Images/Century1.jpg">
        <p>Episode One (18+)</p>
        <p>I lived with my parents and my younger sister Lisa.
            Dad was a successful businessman and mum a Civil Servant that rose to the level of a Director. Uncle Gilbert is our cook. He’s been my 
            parent’s cook even before my sister and I were born. A very nice and hardworking man. Uncle Gilbert is older than dad and ought to be living
            with his family. But he refused to get settled due to reasons best known to him. My uncle, dad’s younger brother visited one day, he told 
            dad that he needed a piece of one of his landed properties in the village.
        </p>
        <p>And the particular one he was demanding was the one dad kept for me whenever I’m ready to build. But dad had told him severally that he should 
            take any other plot, but for that particular piece it was reserved for me.
        </p>
        <p>Dad called for a meeting that evening, mum, my sister, myself, uncle Gilbert and my uncle (dad’s brother) Mr Ike were all present in the meeting.
             Dad informed uncle Gilbert (our cook) that he has decided to settle him in order for to go and take care of himself. Because he was getting no younger.
            Uncle Gilbert was in his early sixties at the time and really needed a break from the chores he does. Dad to him that Lisa my sister have come of age
            and can handle most of the chores including the cooking. Uncle Gilbert tried to convince dad that he can still do the job, though he still looked strong
            enough to do the chores he does.
        </p>
        <p>But dad told him he had made up his mind, he promised him good settlement both in cash and otherwise. He (uncle Gilbert) accepted the offer, though his facial expressions showed discontent.
            Dad pleaded with uncle Ike (his brother) to accept the portion he was offering and take his eyes off the one he kept for me. He as well reluctantly accepted the offer. Uncle Gilbert went
            in to prepare dinner and in less than an hour it (dinner) was served. We all ate a well prepared meal from uncle Gilbert as usual.
        </p>
        <div class="flex">
            <div id="div1"><img src="../Images/GLO.jpg"></div>
            <div id="div2"><img src="../Images/Gidi.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Uncle Ike remained restless all through the night and was going in and out of the kitchen at intervals while Uncle Gilbert prepared the meal. After dinner, we said our family prayers
             and all went to bed. That was the last night my sister and I saw our parents alive.
        </p>
        <p>They didn’t wake up the next morning. We were ready for school and was waiting for mum and dad to take us to school as usual. We all leave the house at the same time everyday.
             Dad would drop us off at school, take mum to her office before going for his business. But that was the last time such happened.
        </p>
        <p>We all waited in vain that morning. Uncle Gilbert was the one who went to their room after much waiting to discover their lifeless bodies. It was the beginning of great sorrow
            for Lisa and I……. Who killed of our parents became the big question on everyone’s lips...
