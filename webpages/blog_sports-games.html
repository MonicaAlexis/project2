            <h1>'I’m only interested in smashing your face in'
                 - Tyson Fury hits back at Anthony Joshua's cheeky jibe</h1>
            <p class="p1">Tyson Fury has hit back at Anthony Joshua after his jibe that his British heavyweight rival should join his management team 
                so they can help him take his career to the next level.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">During an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the British Nigerian boxer said: 'I do think he should come over to Matchroom and 258 Management 
                and let us handle his career,’
            </p>
            <p class="p1">Joshua said. ‘He’s a superstar, he’s a superstar in the making with the right management. He could go all the way.</p>
            <p class="p1">‘Build it up, award him Sports Personality of the Year. That video he did (on Wednesday, when he asked to be removed from the SPOTY shortlist)
                 should be him saying, “I’m accepting my award”, not that, “I don’t want to be a part of it”.

        <p class="p2">Champions League match abandoned after both teams walk off; UEFA investigating after play was halted when Pierre Webo, Basaksehir's assistant coach, 
            was sent off; Turkish club accused the Romanian fourth official of making a racist remark
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/FIFA.jpg">
        <p class="p2">Basaksehir substitute Demba Ba could be seen protesting on the touchline, while PSG players including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe also appeared to be
             demanding an explanation.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Demba Ba asked the official: "Why, when you mention a black guy, do you have to say this black guy?"</p>
        <p class="p2">Istanbul players then walked off the pitch in the 23rd minute in protest, with PSG players following.</p>
        <p class="p2">UEFA initially said the match would restart with a different fourth official "after consultation with both teams",
             but Basaksehir said their players decided not to return to resume the game after the incident.
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/FIFA1.jpg">
        <p class="p2">The match will now restart on Wednesday at 5.55pm with a new team of officials - Dutch referee Danny Makkelie will take charge alongside assistants
             Mario Diks and Marcin Boniek, with Marco Di Bello and Maurizio Mariani in the VAR room and Bartosch Frankowsky as fourth official.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">"A thorough investigation on the incident that took place will be opened immediately."</p>
        <p class="p2">PSG said in a statement "all forms of racism go against the values held by Paris St Germain and the club's chairman, staff and players".</p>
        <p class="p2">It added: "For more than 15 years Paris St Germain has led the fight against discrimination and continues to work to eradicate it in all forms.
             The capital club is today one of the most committed sports clubs striving to end all forms of violence and discrimination."
        </p>
        <img src="../Images/FIFA2.jpg">
        <p class="p2">Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the alleged racist remarks and urged UEFA "to take the necessary measures".</p>
        <p class="p2">Erdogan said on Twitter: "I strongly condemn the racist remarks made against Pierre Webo, member of the technical staff of Basaksehir,
             and I am convinced that UEFA will take the necessary measures."
        </p>
        <p class="p2">The Romanian Football Federation told Sky Sports News it would wait for the outcome of UEFA's investigation before any action is taken.</p>
