        <h1>What is good health?</h1>
        <p>The word health refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. 
            Healthcare exists to help people maintain this optimal state of health.
        </p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), healthcare costs in the United States were $3.5 trillion in 2017.</p>
        <p>However, despite this expenditure, people in the U.S. have a lower life expectancy than people in other developed countries. 
            This is due to a variety of factors, including access to healthcare and lifestyle choices.
        </p>
        <p>Good health is central to handling stress and living a longer, more active life. In this article, we explain the meaning of good health, 
            the types of health a person needs to consider, and how to preserve good health.
        </p>
        <div id="div1"><img src="../Images/Health.jpg"></div>
        <p>In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health with a phrase that modern authorities still apply.</p>
        <p>“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</p>
        <p>In 1986, the WHO made further clarifications:</p>
        <p>“A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.”</p>
        <p>This means that health is a resource to support an individual’s function in wider society, rather than an end in itself. A healthful lifestyle provides the means to lead a full life with meaning and purpose.</p>
        <p>In 2009, researchers publishing inThe Lancet defined health as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and infirmities.</p>
        <p>They base this definition on the idea that the past few decades have seen modern science take significant strides in the awareness of diseases by understanding how they work, discovering new ways to slow or stop them, 
            and acknowledging that an absence of pathology may not be possible.
        </p>
        <h1>Physical health</h1>
        <p>A person who has good physical health is likely to have bodily functions and processes working at their peak.</p>
        <p>This is not only due not only to an absence of disease. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health. People receive medical treatment to maintain the balance, when necessary.</p>
        <p>Physical well-being involves pursuing a healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease. Maintaining physical fitness, for example, can protect and develop the endurance of a person’s breathing and heart function, 
            muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition.
        </p>
        <p>Looking after physical health and well-being also involves reducing the risk of an injury or health issue, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>minimizing hazards in the workplace</li>
            <li>using contraception when having sex</li>
            <li>practicing effective hygiene</li>
            <li>avoiding the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs</li>
            <li>taking the recommended vaccines for a specific condition or country when traveling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good physical health can work in tandem with mental health to improve a person’s overall quality of life.</p>
        <p>For example, mental illness, such as depression, may increase the risk of drug use disorders, according to a 2008 study. 
            This can go on to adversely affect physical health.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h1>Mental health</h1>
        <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, mental health refers to a person’s emotional, social, and psychological well-being. Mental health is as important as physical health as part of a full, active lifestyle.</p>
        <p>It is harder to define mental health than physical health because many psychological diagnoses depend on an individual’s perception of their experience.</p>
        <p>With improvements in testing, however, doctors are now able to identify some physical signs of some types of mental illness in CT scans and genetic tests.</p>
        <p>Good mental health is not only categorized by the absence of depression, anxiety, or another disorder. It also depends on a person’s ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enjoy life</li>
            <li>bounce back after difficult experiences and adapt to adversity</li>
            <li>balance different elements of life, such as family and finances</li>
            <li>feel safe and secure</li>
            <li>achieve their full potential</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Physical and mental health have strong connections. For example, if a chronic illness affects a person’s ability to complete their regular tasks, it may lead to depression and stress. These feelings could be due to financial problems or mobility issues.</p>
        <p>A mental illness, such as depression or anorexia, can affect body weight and overall function.</p>
        <p>It is important to approach “health” as a whole, rather than as a series of separate factors. All types of health are linked, and people should aim for overall well-being and balance as the keys to good health.</p>

        <h1>Nutrition tips for diet</h1>
        <p>1. <b>Include protein with every meal:</b> Including some protein with every meal can help balance blood sugar.
            Some studies suggest higher protein diets can be beneficial for type 2 diabetes.           
            Other research indicates balancing blood sugar can support weight management and cardiovascular health.
        </p>
        <p>2. <b>Eat oily fish:</b>According to research, omega-3 fatty acids in oily fish are essential for cell signaling, gene expression, and brain and eye development.
            Some studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.           
            Other research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 may effectively manage the early stages of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
        </p>
        <p>3. <b>Eat whole grains:</b>The American Heart Association (AHA) recommend people eat whole grains rather than refined grains.
            Whole grains contain nutrients such as B vitamins, iron, and fiber. These nutrients are essential for body functions that include carrying oxygen in the blood, regulating the immune system, and balancing blood sugar.

            <div id="div10"><img src="../Images/Fruit2.jfif"></div>
        </div>
        <p>4. <b>Eat a rainbow: </b>The saying ‘eat a rainbow’ helps remind people to eat different colored fruits and vegetables.
            Varying the color of plant foods means that someone gets a wide variety of antioxidants beneficial to health, for example, carotenoids and anthocyanins.
        </p>
        <p>5. <b>Eat your greens: </b> Dark green leafy vegetables are a great source of nutrition, according to the Department of Agriculture (USDA).
            Leafy greens are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.    
            The USDA suggest that folate in leafy greens may help protect against cancer, while vitamin K helps prevent osteoporosis.
        </p>
        <p>6. <b>Include healthful fats: </b>People should limit their intake of saturated fats while avoiding trans fats, according to the USDA.
            A person can replace these fats with unsaturated fats, which they can find in foods such as avocado, oily fish, and vegetable oils.
        </p>
         <p>8. <b>Eat nuts:</b>According to the AHA, eating one serving of nuts daily in place of red or processed meat, french fries, or dessert may benefit health and prevent long-term weight gain.
            The AHA suggest that Brazil nuts, in particular, may help someone feel fuller and stabilize their blood sugar.
